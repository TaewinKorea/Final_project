## Background and purpose of the project

Outbound capacity plan is important to allocate total orders and currently it seems that outbound volume is getting increased. We need to identify the trend with order data. Along with the trend, adjusted capacity needs to be applied reflecting the current trend.

## Data description and Forecasting

Mean and Standard deviation are shown for each FC and regression model is used for forecast.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

tapply(All_FC_Data$Daily_order, All_FC_Data$FC_Name, mean)
tapply(All_FC_Data$Daily_order, All_FC_Data$FC_Name, sd)

## Conclusion

In order to use Lear regression model for this case, Adjusted R sqare and P-value should be within the proper range. In this case, Every Adjusted R sqares for thress FCs are less than 0.1 which is very low which indicate the inferred model is not explainable for the real situation. Besides, P-value is much more than 0.05 which also makes the model not trustworthy. Due to the high fluctuation in daily order in each fulfillment center, capacity management is very difficult. In order to reduce the order fluctuation in each fulfillment center, combining fulfillment centers into 1 or 2 seems required.
